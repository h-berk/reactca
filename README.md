# React CA - Extension of Movie App Labs
React CA for Web App Dev 2 - Hasan Berk 20093361

Firstly, I redid all the React Labs. I fixed any errors I previously encountered, and completed all exercises. I needed a good foundation before I added my own stuff. 

Fixed the must watch list. You can now add upcoming movies, which are tagged when you add them to your must watch list.

Redesigned the filter card, changed the colour and image, and changed to TMDB Client title to HB Movies.

New views added - Must Watch List, Popular Movies, Popular Actors, Favourite Actors.

Actors Data Model Created.

Popular Actors page shows the current most popular actors, and their popularity score. You can favourite them, or see more information about them.

When actors are favourited, they also get tagged, and you can view them in the favourite actors page. 

When you want more information about an actor, it leads you to the actor details page, which has their biography, what they're known for, birthday and birthplace. 

Actors pages are routed with the urls /actors and /actors/:id respectively. 

App has full caching support.

Filtering works for both movies and actors.
